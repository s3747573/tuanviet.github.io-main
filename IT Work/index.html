              <p>He works for a hospital as an Information Systems Technician where he helps support close to 2000 people and over 1000 devices. 
                On a daily basis, although it can vary Zach would naturally check the ticketing system of the hospital, answering phone calls, 
                solving problems in his department, creating user accounts for patients. He spends most of his time in the IT office where the computer 
                set-up is and on the computer he uses many tools to help manage and store data. One of the common challenge in IT is the job will always 
                be different, ‘putting out fire’ and rarely get to do what you desperately want to.</p>
