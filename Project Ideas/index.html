            <p><strong>Scalping has become a serious problem for online trading especially in the recent years. 
              Scalper bots are hoarding large amount of products in a blink of an eye and resell them at magnified price for quick profits. 
              Bot Defender is a software integrated into retailers’ website to help fight against this underlying issue.</strong></p>
              <p>Holidays season is coming in 2020 and so is the launch of many new technologies; Most notable ones are the release of the new ‘next-generation’ consoles namely the 
                PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X with a sprinkle of RTX 3090s on PC platform. However, for many gaming fanatics as well as kids’ promised Christmas present by their parents, 
                the joy of nabbing the newly distributed console was cut short by an underlying issue that have plagued trading since as long as it exists – SCALPING.</p>

               <p>Since the start of the console launches, RTX 3090 cards were being sold by scalpers at 220% of its MSRP. Until now the cards was still being sold around 140% which is
                  preposterous for pricing of a piece of hardware (Klotz 2020). In total, according to Driscoll scalpers have made about $8,669,418 on RTX 3090 cards alone, statistics 
                  are even more significant if other cards in RTX 30 series was included.</p>

                  <p>At the same time, PS5 both Physical and Digital editions are being inflated from roughly 200% up to 350% beyond MSRP. Scalpers profited the entirety of more than $34 million
                     according to Tom’s Hardware.</p>

                    <p>Xbox series consoles shared the same story but was a bit tamer in comparison. The Xbox Series X was sold at the average of 170% of its original MSRP and scalpers have
                       made the total profit of $23.5 million so far (Klotz 2020).</p>

          <h3>What is BOT DEFENDER?</h3>
          </section>
        <section id="body" class="content"
        <p>
          Due to the limited quantities during the console launch, scalpers made use of high demand and product scarcity to make profit by buying them in bulk and then resell at an exorbitant price. 
          However, scalpers don’t stop there, in order to snag to as many products as quick as possible, scalpers have resulted to use All in One bots (AIO) to automate the entire customer buying 
          journey from searching, checking stock, add to basket and check-outs (Netacea n.d.).
        </p>
        <p>These online bots attack their targets with different IP addresses, residential or IoT devices. 
          Therefore, standard IP-centric detectors or rule-based defenses like Wireless Application Firewalls (WAFs) are no longer efficient in preventing scalper bots and the reliable CAPTCHA is only 
          propitious for lesser complexity bots but no match for the best ones as they are near indistinguishable from a human user and cannot be exposed without expert knowledge (Gaffar 2020). 
          Thus, a 
          <strong>specialized protection solution</strong>
           that is capable of making decision in real time is crucial to fight against scalpers.</p>
           <p>Bot Defender is a service tailored to protect, redirect and notify websites from malicious activities. Advanced bots mimicks the human behavior, Bot Defender utilizes real-time¬ behavioral 
             analysis to help detect and block these bots from even entering the site. The service will evaluate the requests coming to customers’ website and put them in categories.</p>
              <figure><img src="Project Images/Model.png" width="400" height="400" alt="" class="center"></figure>
              <p><strong>Recognized/Known Bots</strong> are detected through HTTP fingerprinting, pattern matching. The system will then authenticate the good bots from known attackers.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>New threats</strong> 
                represent the real challenge. They are identified via statistical and behavioral detection, using data from server-side fingerprints, a JS rendering engine, SDK inputs and session
                 tracking.
              </p>
              <p>Bot Defender also integrate both server-side and client-side bot detection because most advanced bots leverage exactly the same browsers as human users—Chrome, Firefox, Safari—and are 
                able to forge consistent fingerprints. Server-side fingerprinting must therefore be combined with client-side signals. Bot Defender then analyze and record browsers, apps and device features,
                 as well as behavioral signals such as mouse movements and touch events, in order to accurately detect the most sophisticated bots.</p>
                 <p>Bot Defender bot management are fully automated therefore whenever an attack is detected, no intervention is needed: the solution automatically applies the most appropriate response for each threat,
                    including new threats.</p>

                           - an evolving branch of computational algorithms that are designed to emulate human intelligence by learning from the 
                          surrounding environment. Machine learning is crucial in analyzing the bots’ behavior on clients’ website, alongside the client-side website, Bot Defender would need its own server for user data and
