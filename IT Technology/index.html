            <p><strong>•	Cyber-security and Privacy</strong></p>
              <p>o	Cyber-security</p>
              <p>Cyber-security refers to the measures taken to protect a computer or computer system against unauthorized access externally (Amtrust n.d.). A robust cybersecurity policy protects 
                secure, critical or sensitive data and prevents it from falling in to the hands of malicious third parties.</p>
                <p>o	Data privacy</p>
                <p>Data privacy can be defined as “information security that deals with the proper handling of data concerning consent, notice, sensitivity and regulatory concerns.” Essentially, 
                  consumers have a right to know how their personal information is collected, stored and shared before they give consent to access their information.</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>What’s the impact?</strong> 
                    Companies are making it a priority to protect their organizations from data breaches by offering data security training, creating a company-wide data breach policy such as:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> -	 Keeping Data Safe: </strong>
                    Because many data breaches happen because of employee error, staff should only have access to the information vital to their particular role within the company. Additionally, 
                    consider records retention programs that require employees to purge files both on their computers and any hard copies they keep (according to the program), destroying the information in the proper manner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> -	 Data Encryption:</strong> 
                    All data, whether on a personal device, computer, or server should be protected by proper encryption. Companies in many states can benefit from safe harbor exemptions that only apply if the company can 
                    prove the data was encrypted before a breach.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> -	 Update Security Software:</strong> 
                    Companies should utilize firewalls, anti-virus software and anti-spyware programs to help ensure sensitive data cannot be easily accessed by hackers. These security programs also require regular updates 
                    to keep them free from vulnerabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>(AmTrust n.d.)</p>
                  <p><strong>•	Machine Learning</strong></p>
                  <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence, which build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as “training data,” in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly
                     programmed to perform the task (Zhang 2020).</p>
                     <p>
                      <strong>What’s the impact?</strong> 
                      Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning will develop from $8 billion in 2016 to $47 billion by 2020. The information provided by Google, 50-70% of emails in Gmail are spam. With the help of machine learning 
                      algorithms, Google makes it possible to square such unwanted communication with 99% precision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong> -	 Spear Phishing:</strong> 
                      Traditional phishing detection techniques less in speed and accuracy to reliably find all the malicious links leaving users at risk. The solution to this problem lies in the predictive URL classification models which are
                       based on the latest machine learning algorithms that can find patterns that reveal a malicious sender’s email. Those models are prepared to recognize small scale behaviors like e-mail headers, body-data, designs, etc. From 
                       these prepared models can be utilized to identify whether the e-mail is malicious or not (Think Palm 2020.

                      <strong> -	 Web-shell:</strong> 
                      It is a piece of code that is maliciously stacked into an online site in arrange to permit the attacker to form alterations on the internet root catalog of the server. This implies that fully get to the database of the framework 
                      is picked up. In case it is an e-commerce site, attackers could be getting to the database on a visit premise in arrange to gather credit card data of the client base. Targets of web shell-using attackers are regularly backend eCommerce 
                      stages. The major hazard of eCommerce stages is related to online installments which are anticipated to be secure and secret (Think Palm 2020).
