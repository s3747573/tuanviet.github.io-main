               <p>As the result of 16personalities test, my personality type is Mediator which is a rare personality type; Tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and I apply a caring and creative approach to everything I do. Mediators seem quiet and shy on the outside but on the inside they are vibrant and passionate. Therefore, though an introvert, mediators are among the most social able of all introverts.</p>
               <p>Mediators find themselves drawn to individuals which remind them of themselves, people with similar belief and nature; Then Mediators can feel accepted and understood.</p>
               <p>Having said that, from my own experience, mediators such as myself are capable of working together with all kinds of people through Intuitive and Prospecting traits which help them see diverse perspectives. As a colleague, mediators like myself contributes the most through empathetic communication style, I like honesty but still kind which can set a positive tone in the workplace.</p>

            <p><strong>Mai Ly</strong> – 
              <strong>Digital Marketing</strong>
               - one of my closest friends since the start of my college life, we shared many wonderful experiences together. I and Ly even went on cross-campus exchange to Melbourne last semester together. She is a 
              <strong>Defender</strong>
              according to the personality test which means she is a supportive spirit who always help friends get job done. There really is no better person to be in a team with.</p>

              <p><strong>Viet Anh</strong> – 
                <strong>Digital Marketing</strong>
                 – He is also one I have met since the start. He is an extremely clever and hardworking student and experienced in the SAS team. Additionally, he always has strong opinions and know how to grab attention; Thus, makes him a good leader of the team. However, I personally was not as close with him as I was with Ly although we are in the same major due to the fact that he went on exchange to Canada. That said, his 
                 <strong>Campaigner</strong>
                  personalities mean he is a “content machine” where ideas will just keep coming. His ability to brainstorm is unmatched and treating every suggestion with tolerance makes him an imperative addition to the team.</p>

                     – 
                     <strong>Software Engineering</strong>
                      – He is the newest member of the team. Although we are not as close, he is the one helping everyone else in the team due to his background in IT. His 
                      <strong>Adventurer</strong>
                       traits made it comfortable to work with as he would always give out advices and solve problems with charm and excellent networking skills. He may be a new addition but a welcoming and valuable one.</p>
